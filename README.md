# Political-Hangman

For my project, I am going to create a political hangman game. The object of this game is to guess the political message that will fill up
the blank lines. The users will be given hints in order to help them with their guessing. If the user presses a key and it is the
correct word, the letter will appear on screen in their respected spot. However, if the user fails to guess correctly, the first part of
the body will be drawn. The user in this game has six chances to guess these letters right. In addition to this, the user will also have 
one free lifeline which will give the user the ability to have three random words revealed to them. After this lifeline, if the user is 
not able to guess the words, a full body will be drawn onto the screen and the user will have to try again.
